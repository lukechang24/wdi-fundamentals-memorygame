  	  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  	    <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
  	  <h3>Why should you play?</h3>
  	    <p>This game tests not only your ability to memorize cards, but also your ability to make educated guesses on where each card may be by using process of elimination. As you narrow down the options, the game becomes more intense, resulting in a stressful, yet fun experience.</p>
